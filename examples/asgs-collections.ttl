Most MBs contain 30 to 60 dwellings although some are specifically designed to have zero. This provides an additional level of confidentiality for data released on the ASGS as the difference in data released on multiple statistical areas is always at least one MB. Mesh Blocks like other ABS structures in the ASGS are stable for 5 years and are updated to reflect changes such as new housing developments every 5 years.
